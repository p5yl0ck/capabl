So natually the trip duration would increase towards April May and June."

    "3. Reduce the numbers of features in the training data that we currently use. The algorithm will still fit the training data very well, but due to the decreased number of features, it will build less complex models. This should increase the bias and decrease the variance."

    "In this project we covered various aspects of the Machine learning development cycle. We observed that the data exploration and variable analysis is a very important aspect of the whole cycle and should be done for thorough understanding of the data. We also cleaned the data while exploring as there were some outliers which should be treated before feature engineering. Further we did feature engineering to filter and gather only the optimal features which are more significant and covered most of the variance in the dataset. Then finally we trained the models on the optimum featureset to get the results. "
